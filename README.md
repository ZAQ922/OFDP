# OFDP
A python program that screen grabs on Windows and Linux, working on OsX. The main idea is to just familiarize with screen grabbing libraries and how to make a program "see" particular pixels.
Each function has comments on what it does. It's not very linear or grouped at the moment because it still doesn't fully operate. Getting the correct pixel locations and calculations varies per computer monitor.
